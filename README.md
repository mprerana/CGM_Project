Class Time (Location): MW: 8.30 AM - 9.30 AM (213), F: 9.30AM-10.30AM



CGM Project Deliverables:

1. Codebase+ReadMe: to be hosted as Github repository. [Note: Instructions for codebase will be shared soon in next mail. Keep it ready and hosted in Git to be integrated. In readme file on Git, give the software prerequisites for running the code then explaining how to run the code in brief.]
2. Term Paper in IEEE double-column format (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html in .docx/.pdf). [Note: Strict Penalization would be done based on plagiarism. Zero tolerance to plagiarism. Adhere to the standard template as given. For term paper writing, follow regulation Pt. 4.
3. Live Working Demo during evaluation and Paper PPT (max 10 slides-Slide 1: Problem statement, Slide 2: Motivation, Slide 3: Key contributions highlighting novelty
4. Medium Post: Write a blogpost on your paper with appropriate code snippets highlighting novelty. You can take excerpts from your term ppr as well. Submit the link in readme.

Submission Protocol: Submit a single .zip folder with name GRP_#(Rollnos).zip. Enter the complete rollnos of the members in bracket comma seperated, # replaced with group no. Inside zip file, you should give the following:
1. Term ppr in .pdf
2. Text file containing:
i) Group details: Project Title, Group Members names, rollno, section
ii) GIT Repo Link
iii) Medium Post Link
iv) PPT
Do not submit codebase in zip folder it should be hosted in Git only. Submit the .zip folder to cgm.iiits@gmail.com

Regulations in Project Work:
1. Max team size=6 allowed. More members should result in proper work distribution and more work quantum.
2. Clearly demarcate the work so that during evaluation marks can be allotted as per the work distribution.
3. Ppr should be self written and should be free of any plagiarised content from any web sources. Excellent submission of term pprs shall be also considered for submission in reputed forums. In case you take a particular code snippet from any web sources so give proper credits in the medium post/ readme (GIT).
4. Term paper should have following subsections: i) Abstract: outlining your problem statement, workflow and key results in brief, ii) Problem Statement: clearly out line the problem statement, motivation, key challenges, key highlights/contributions in the work, how do you handle the various challenges? Core Novelty is very much of importance in view of term paper
iii) Proposed Methodology: Put architecture diagram, key components explanation, mathematical preliminaries, algorithms in this section
iv) Results: Results and Analysis, Discussion, comparison with other SOTA pprs
v) Conclusion & Future Direction
5. For blog post, you may take excerpts from paper as well.
