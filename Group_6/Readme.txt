A unique way of musical notes generation based on neural networks is put forward in this project.It works by taking existing notes or music as a raw data on which required procedure is performed in order to generate a soothing and pleasant music.
This project proposes the procedure that can be applied to generate music efficiently using modern methods of stylizing the notes.

Generate_Music.ipynb (Complete_Code/Generate_Music.ipynb) is the model responsible for generating musical notes . 
In the repository we have the initial sequence of notes that is taken as the input and the subsequent musical notes are generated as output .Some samples of the inputs with respective outputs are given in folder (results). 

Required dependencies :

- Keras
- Pandas
- numpy
